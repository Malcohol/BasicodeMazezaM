I have tested the program by loading generated BASICODE audio on several emulated platforms, including C64 and ZX Spectrum. Unfortunately, I have not managed to get BASICODE working on any Vic-20 emulator, so I'm not 100% sure if it works on that platform. If you have an actual Vic-20, I love to know if it works. 

To generate BASICODE audio for loading into an old computer, I created a [patch for the BASICODE interpreter](https://github.com/robhagemans/basicode-interpreter/pull/45) mentioned above.
